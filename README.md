# Amateur detective

You are the newly appointed detective of the police station.

It has come to your attention that a hacker has gotten into the police database
and has been messing around with the internal records - adding and editing
files.

To catch the hacker, you first need to know which files were tampered with.
Luckily for you, the hacker was not too careful and left some evidence behind.

## Goal

Use `git status` to uncover the hacker's destruction. Find the file that they
added and edited.

Update your answers in `answers.txt`.

## Submission

Remember to only commit the `answers.txt` file!

```bash
git add answers.txt
git commit -m "Submit answers"
```

To submit your progress, run the `submit.sh` script found in this repository:

```bash
bash submit.sh
```
